[CCPROG3 MP: That's Life]
By Andre Dominic H. Ponce and Joshue Salvador A. Jadie

HOW TO RUN AND EXECUTE PROGRAM
- The program will be ran using the Command Line / Terminal

Steps:
1) Create a folder named "That's Life!" in the Desktop and 
   extract the zip file to the created folder. 

2) If you have JavaFX already installed and PATH variable set,
   skip to step 5

3) Download JavaFX SDK (any latest version) zip in: 

   https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/#latest

   Afterwards, extract the folder and place it inside the Java 
   folder in the Program Files (If Windows).

4) Add a new value to the Path Environment Variable: 
   
   Go to "Edit Environmental Variables" and edit the "Path" Variable:
   add a new value: [IF VERSION IS 14.0.2.1]

   "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-14.0.2.1\bin"

5) Open Command Line or Terminal 

6) Go to the directory of the created folder "That's Life!"

7) To compile all files, input: 

javac --module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-14.0.2.1\lib" --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml *.java

8) To run the main GUI program, input: 

java --module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-14.0.2.1\lib" --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml View

9) The program might take a while to load, this is because of the Images and ImageViews to be processed to 
   build the board and other scenes requiring images. 

   The command line will indicate if the program is almost ready to launch:
   "Loading 25%..."
   "Loading 50%..."
   "Loading 75%..."
   "Loading 100%..."

   By the time "Loading 100%..." is printed, the application should launch. 

NOTES: The value of the --module-path will change depending on the JavaFX version downloaded 
       and directory set according to your use. 

       After compiling, the command line / terminal will display that View.java uses 
       unchecked or unsafe operations, specifically the EventHandlers which is integral
       and important for the Controller. That said, the warnings shall be disregarded.
